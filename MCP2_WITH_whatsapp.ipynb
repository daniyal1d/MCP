            "2.  **Contextual Data Acquisition:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Defines how the model obtains contextual data. This includes specifying the data sources (e.g., APIs, databases, sensors), authentication methods, and error handling procedures.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Using a weather API:** The MCP would specify the API endpoint, authentication credentials (API key), request parameters (location, time), and how to handle API errors (e.g., timeouts, invalid responses). It might dictate a fallback to historical averages if the API is unavailable.\n",
            "        *   **Accessing user location data:** The MCP would outline the process for requesting location permissions from the user (if needed), retrieving location data from the device's GPS sensor, and handling cases where location data is unavailable or inaccurate.\n",
            "3.  **Contextual Feature Engineering:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Specifies how contextual data is transformed into features suitable for the model. This includes defining feature engineering techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding, normalization, time series decomposition) and handling missing or invalid data.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Encoding categorical features:** If the context includes a \"day of the week\" feature, the MCP could specify that it should be one-hot encoded into seven binary features (one for each day of the week).\n",
            "        *   **Normalizing numerical features:** If the context includes \"temperature\" (in Celsius), the MCP could specify that it should be normalized to a range between 0 and 1 based on historical temperature ranges for the given location.\n",
            "4.  **Contextual Model Adaptation:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Specifies how the model's parameters or structure are adjusted based on the contextual data. This can include techniques like transfer learning, fine-tuning, or dynamic model selection.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Transfer learning:** A model trained on data from one region could be fine-tuned on data from a new region, using the new region's climate context to adjust the model's parameters.\n",

            "5.  **Contextual Explainability:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Defines how the model's reliance on contextual data is documented and explained. This includes techniques like feature importance analysis, sensitivity analysis, and counterfactual explanations.\n",

            "*   **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations):** MLOps encompasses the practices for automating and managing the machine learning lifecycle. An MCP could be a component of an MLOps pipeline, ensuring that models are trained and deployed with the appropriate contextual data.\n",
            "*   **Context-Aware Computing:** The field of context-aware computing deals with creating systems that adapt their behavior based on the user's context. An MCP provides a framework for integrating machine learning models into context-aware systems.\n",
            "*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** As mentioned previously, the contextual explainability component of the MCP aligns with the goals of XAI, helping to understand and trust model predictions by analyzing their reliance on contextual factors.\n",

            "*   **Data Sources:** IoT sensors on the equipment, maintenance logs, weather APIs.\n",
            "*   **Feature Engineering:** Time-series analysis of sensor data, one-hot encoding of equipment type, normalization of numerical features.\n",
            "*   **Model Adaptation:** Fine-tuning the model based on the specific equipment type and environmental conditions.\n",

            "    *   **Definition:** Specifies the types of contextual data relevant to the model. This includes defining data formats, units of measurement, and allowable ranges.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **For a weather forecasting model:** Location (latitude, longitude), time of year, historical weather patterns, altitude, and atmospheric pressure. Each would have specific data types (e.g., latitude/longitude as floating-point numbers) and acceptable ranges.\n",
            "        *   **For a fraud detection model:** User location (IP address, GPS coordinates), transaction amount, time of day, merchant category, and user's past transaction history.\n",
            "2.  **Contextual Data Acquisition:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Defines how the model obtains contextual data. This includes specifying the data sources (e.g., APIs, databases, sensors), authentication methods, and error handling procedures.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Using a weather API:** The MCP would specify the API endpoint, authentication credentials (API key), request parameters (location, time), and how to handle API errors (e.g., timeouts, invalid responses). It might dictate a fallback to historical averages if the API is unavailable.\n",
            "        *   **Accessing user location data:** The MCP would outline the process for requesting location permissions from the user (if needed), retrieving location data from the device's GPS sensor, and handling cases where location data is unavailable or inaccurate.\n",
            "3.  **Contextual Feature Engineering:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Specifies how contextual data is transformed into features suitable for the model. This includes defining feature engineering techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding, normalization, time series decomposition) and handling missing or invalid data.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Encoding categorical features:** If the context includes a \"day of the week\" feature, the MCP could specify that it should be one-hot encoded into seven binary features (one for each day of the week).\n",
            "        *   **Normalizing numerical features:** If the context includes \"temperature\" (in Celsius), the MCP could specify that it should be normalized to a range between 0 and 1 based on historical temperature ranges for the given location.\n",
            "4.  **Contextual Model Adaptation:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Specifies how the model's parameters or structure are adjusted based on the contextual data. This can include techniques like transfer learning, fine-tuning, or dynamic model selection.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Transfer learning:** A model trained on data from one region could be fine-tuned on data from a new region, using the new region's climate context to adjust the model's parameters.\n",
            "        *   **Dynamic model selection:** Depending on the user's device type (context), a different version of the model (optimized for low-power devices or high-performance devices) could be selected.\n",
            "5.  **Contextual Explainability:**\n",
            "    *   **Definition:** Defines how the model's reliance on contextual data is documented and explained. This includes techniques like feature importance analysis, sensitivity analysis, and counterfactual explanations.\n",
            "    *   **Examples:**\n",
            "        *   **Feature importance:** The MCP could specify that the model should provide a feature importance score for each contextual feature, indicating how much each feature contributes to the model's predictions.\n",
            "        *   **Counterfactual explanations:** The MCP could specify that the model should provide counterfactual explanations, showing how the prediction would change if specific contextual features were different.

            "*   **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations):** MLOps encompasses the practices for automating and managing the machine learning lifecycle. An MCP could be a component of an MLOps pipeline, ensuring that models are trained and deployed with the appropriate contextual data.\n",
            "*   **Context-Aware Computing:** The field of context-aware computing deals with creating systems that adapt their behavior based on the user's context. An MCP provides a framework for integrating machine learning models into context-aware systems.\n",
            "*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** As mentioned previously, the contextual explainability component of the MCP aligns with the goals of XAI, helping to understand and trust model predictions by analyzing their reliance on contextual factors.\n",

            "*   **Data Sources:** IoT sensors on the equipment, maintenance logs, weather APIs.\n",
            "*   **Feature Engineering:** Time-series analysis of sensor data, one-hot encoding of equipment type, normalization of numerical features.\n",
